# SSVQE istance
SSVQE is a variant of VQE that allows obtaining the first $k$ eigenvalues of an observable $H$. SSQVE introduces a new idea by adding weights to help prioritize optimizing for the term with the largest weight. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09434)

This notebook is my solution to the assessment about the creation of an instance of SSVQE, as part of the Variational algorithm design course (https://qiskit.org/learn/course/algorithm-design/).
